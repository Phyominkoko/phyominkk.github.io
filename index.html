			<p class="p" >Tyrannosaurus rex is likely the most famous dinosaur known to man. Not only was this mega-beast the largest predator in its ecosystem, it also had teeth as long as your forearm and a bite force to match. It could eat prey as big as a school bus and did so for at least 2 million years. It was still standing until the end of the age of dinosaurs when an asteroid decimated the planet. Still, while we know a good bit about T. rex, we know comparably little about its evolutionary history.
			Researchers have long contended that Daspletosaurus, a rare species of theropod found in Montana, may have later evolved into T. rex. And in a new study published in the November 2022 edition of PeerJ, researchers have uncovered another species of Daspletosaurus, named Daspletosaurus wilsoni that, in addition to the two other known species, may help bridge the gap.
			According to the paper, D. wilsoni “displays a unique combination of ancestral and derived characteristics” that shows it was an intermediate species before T. rex, that lived 76 million years ago.</p>

				<p class="famous">In a feat that was 50 years in making, palaeontologists have finally discovered Supersaurus, the longest dinosaur ever known. The Jurassic period dinosaur, 128 to 137 feet in size, lived 150 million years ago and had a long neck and a long tail. Even the shortest Supersaurus was longer than 108-feet-long Diplodocus, which was previously believed to be the longest dinosaur ever. A palaeontologist at the Arizona Museum of Natural History, Brian Curtice headed the research that made the discovery. The findings were presented on November 5 in a virtual conference organised by the Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology, and are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. When the first specimen of Supersaurus was discovered in 1972 in Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry, Colorado, the United States, the finding site was a crammed bonebed. According to Curtice, the whole find was a bone salad. Jim Jensen, a dinosaur field worker, excavated the quarry. Jensen discovered differently sized shoulder girdle bones that appeared to belong to different dinosaurs. Jensen published his findings claiming to discover three sauropods — long-necked and long-tailed dinosaurs. Later, palaeontologists found mistakes in Jensen’s analysis. According to Curtice, the bones Jensen thought belonged to three dinosaurs were actually from a single Supersaurus. The bones were differently sized because of the deformities they underwent over time and there were cracks in them.</p>

						<p class="famous">We have few clues for what noises dinosaurs might have made while they ruled the Earth before being killed off 66 million years ago. The remarkable stony remains uncovered by palaeontologists offer evidence of the physical prowess of these creatures, but not a great deal about how they interacted and communicated. Sound doesn't fossilise, of course.
						From what we know about animal behaviour, however, dinosaurs were almost certainly not silent.
						Now with the help of new, rare fossils and advanced analysis techniques, scientists are starting to piece together some of the clues about how dinosaurs might have sounded.
						There is no single answer to this puzzle. Dinosaurs dominated the planet for around 179 million years and during that time, evolved into an enormous array of different shapes and sizes. Some were tiny, like the diminutive Albinykus, which weighed under a kilogram (2.2lbs) and was probably less than 2ft (60cm) long. Others were among the biggest animals to have ever lived on land, such as the titanosaur Patagotitan mayorum, which may have weighed up to 72 tonnes. They ran on two legs, or plodded on four. And along with these diverse body shapes, they would have produced an equally wide variety of noises.
						Some dinosaurs had greatly elongated necks – up to 16m (52ft) long in the largest sauropods – which would have likely altered the sounds they produced (think about what happens when a trombone is extended). Others had bizarre skull structures that, much like wind instruments, could have amplified and altered the tone the animals produced. One such creature, a herbivorous hadrosaur named Parasaurolophus tubicen, would have been responsible for the fearsome calls described at the start of this article.The polar dinosaurs revealing ancient secrets.The enduring mystery of T rex's arms.How mammals won the dinosaurs' world.</p>

			<p class="famous">Dinosaurs: understandably you may have questions. Questions like ‘just how formidable was the Tyrannosaurus Rex?’, ‘what was the largest dinosaur of them all?’, and ‘why does the pot-bellied Nothronychus look that weird?'.

			Fortunately, palaeontologists have these answers ­­­– they’ve uncovered much about this intriguing group of reptiles that roamed the Earth 230 - 66 million years ago.

			From the meteor that made them extinct, to what they may have looked like (feathers and all), below you can learn everything worth knowing about dinosaurs from our top experts. You can also find the latest dino discoveries, such as the Scottish fossils recently identified as Scleromochlus, a flightless, cat-sized early ancestor to the winged pterosaurs.

			The latest Dinosaur discoveries and news
			With their teeny arm span, we can only imagine how annoying a back itch must have been for a T. Rex. But a recently discovered dinosaur may have suffered from the same plight. At least, that’s what we can guess from its fossils.

			While its skeleton was a gigantic 11 metres long and weighing more than four tonnes, the newly named Meraxes gigas also wielded two disproportionally small forelimbs.

			Interestingly, the Meraxes became extinct some 20 million years before the T. Rex. While very distantly related, the two species evolved their tiny arms separately for a survival advantage. What advantage exactly? Researchers aren’t sure, but some scientists have theorised the tiny limbs could help with non-predatory activities, like supporting movement or holding during mating.</p>

							<p class="famous">Dinosaurs are often thought of as creatures thriving in warm climates and lush tropical jungles. But now, new research challenges this idea: Rather, dinosaurs endured freezing temperatures, which ultimately allowed them to reign in the Jurassic. 
							The study's lead author, paleontologist Paul Olsen, ventured out to the Junggar basin in China in 2016, a region rich in dinosaur fossils and footprints. On the very first day, 		and at their very first stop, Olsen’s team stumbled upon something much coarser than sand and gravel. It seemed quite unusual to Olsen.
							"We didn't move for three hours arguing about what this is," Olsen, who led the research published(Opens in a new window) in the journal Science Advances, told Mashable.The research team narrowed the curious deposits down to "ice-rafted debris," which are sediments containing pebbles that formed some 206 million years ago. (Ice amassed in the water next to land, ultimately transporting and dropping terrestrial rocks lodged in the ice to a lake bottom.) Its presence in the area indicates floating ice once existed(Opens in a new window) in a region where dinosaurs roamed, and left clear tracks. The researchers also determined the Junggar basin was located above the Arctic circle, meaning it was extremely cold there, particularly in the winter. 
							"The whole picture of dinosaurs is backward. They're primarily cold-adapted animals," Olsen emphasized. </p>
